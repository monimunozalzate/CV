        <h3>Profile</h3>
        <p>I am a Web Developer passionate about the Front-end world. I create experiences for the users working with HTML, CSS, JS in web and mobile designs. I use Jest and Selenium for testing and have knowledge in JAVA and MySQL.
        <br> I consider myself a creative, curious and constantly innovating person. I believe that these qualities are the key to allowing me to come up with effective solutions, and I love the idea of learning by working and putting a lot of attitude into the process.
        <br>I started playing violin at the age of 6, which made me a very empathetic, disciplined, resilient, and goal oriented person with a lot of experience working in small and large groups.</p>
